# Learning OpenGL

3D things are cool. I'm trying to learn how to do them.

I'm going to be following along loosely with the [ThinMatrix OpenGL
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP),
though I'm being fairly liberal with the implementation in an attempt to make
it a little more... Haskell-shaped.

Hopefully, as I work through the tutorial, this repository will become a little
more library-shaped.
